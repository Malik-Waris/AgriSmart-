# AgriSmart-
An IoT based smart Agricultural Monitoring System Pairing a Mobile App (created using React Native) to different sensors applied in the field.
The idea of our project (AGRI-SMART) holds immense potential to revolutionize the way farming is conducted, making it more efficient, sustainable, and technologically advanced. By integrating IoT technologies into agriculture, we are venturing into a domain where innovation and creativity can bring about significant positive changes. Through our project, we will have the opportunity to address crucial challenges faced by the agricultural sector, such as optimizing resource management, enhancing crop yield, and reducing environmental impact. By designing and implementing a smart agriculture system, (AGRI-SMART) will contribute to the development of a cutting-edge solution that empowers farmers to make informed decisions based on real-time data from various sensors. Additionally, our project will allow us to dive deep into the exciting fields of IoT, data analytics, machine learning, and automation, enabling us to gain valuable skills that are highly sought after in today's job market. As we embark on this platform, we will have the opportunity to collaborate with experts in the field, engage in interdisciplinary research, and apply theoretical knowledge to practical problem-solving. By developing an IoT-based smart agriculture system, we are paving the way for a more sustainable and efficient future in agriculture. Our project has the potential to positively impact on our agriculture system.
