1. Problem statement 
The traditional systems of agriculture often lack efficient monitoring and automation mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal resource utilization, energy waste, and limited productivity. Further in traditional agriculture system, farmers face challenges in accessing real-time data on crop conditions and environmental factors, hindering their ability to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and other farming practices. There is a need for an integrated solution that leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor and automate farming activities. This valuable information empowers farmers to make informed decisions regarding agriculture activities, leading to optimal water usage, reduced wastage, and improved crop yield.
Objectives
* Real-time Monitoring: (AGRI-SMART) enables farmers to monitor crucial parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity in real time, providing valuable insights for effective decision-making.

* Efficient Resource Management: Optimize the use of resources such as water, fertilizers etc. by precisely delivering them based on crop needs, reducing waste, and improving resource efficiency.

* Enable remote accessibility: Create a user-friendly mobile app interface that allows farmers to access the collected data remotely, providing them with real-time information on their crops' status and environmental conditions.

* Weather Monitoring and Forecasting: Gather real-time weather data and forecasts to assist farmers in making informed decisions related to planting, harvesting, and crop protection measures.

* Globalization: Access sensors data from anywhere in using android application.

* Enhanced Crop Yield and Quality: Employ precision farming techniques, leveraging IoT technologies to optimize growing conditions, resulting in increased crop yields, improved product quality, and reduced post-harvest losses.

* Empowering Farmers: Bridge the information gap and provide access to knowledge, best practices, and expert advice through mobile applications, web-based platforms, and community networks, empowering farmers with the necessary tools and resources to thrive.
